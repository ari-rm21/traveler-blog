    Navigating airports can be a stressful part of any trip, but with the right tips, you can turn it into a smooth and even enjoyable experience. Whether you're a frequent flyer or a first-time traveler, here are some of the best airport tips to ensure your journey starts on the right foot:
</p>
<p>
    <b>1. Check In Early and Go Paperless</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Skip the lines by checking in online 24 hours before your flight. Most airlines offer mobile boarding passes, which you can easily store on your phone. Not only does this save time, but it's also eco-friendly and reduces the chance of losing your boarding pass.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>2. Pack Smart and Light</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure your carry-on complies with the airline's size and weight limits to avoid surprises at the gate. Keep liquids in containers of 100ml or less, stored in a transparent, resealable bag for easy inspection. Pack your essentials—ID, tickets, electronics, and chargers—where they're easily accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>3. Stay Updated on Flight Information</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep an eye on your flight status through the airline's app or flight tracking tools. Delays and gate changes can happen unexpectedly, so staying informed will help you avoid last-minute stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>4. Prepare for Security Screening</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure your electronics are fully charged and easily accessible, as they will likely need to be removed from your bag during screening. Be aware of any country-specific security regulations regarding liquids or electronics to avoid delays.</li>
</ul>
